# denoising
A VST-based denoising framework for removing thermal noise in magnitude MR imageseries.

You can start by running denoisingDemo.m to see how the denoising method would work for a simulated diffusion dataset.

More details on the method and its utility for diffusion can be found in the paper: X. Ma, K. UÄŸurbil, and X. Wu, Denoise magnitude diffusion magnetic resonance images via variance-stabilizing transformation and optimal singular-value manipulation. NeuroImage, 2020. 215: p. 116852. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116852
